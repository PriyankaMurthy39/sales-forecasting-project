In real-world companies, sales data is often scattered across systems and underutilized. 
Business teams struggle to understand revenue trends, measure the effectiveness of discounts, 
and accurately forecast future sales. This project addresses the need for a data-driven 
approach to analyze historical sales performance and predict future revenue to support 
better business decisions.
